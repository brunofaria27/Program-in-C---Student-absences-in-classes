# Question
We want to make a survey about the absence of students at the first Fundamentals test Computing for each of the 14 existing classes. For each class, a set of values, with the first two values in the set corresponding to the identification 
of the class (A, or B, or C, ...) and the number of students enrolled, and the remaining values in this set contain the number of student registration and the letter A or P in case the student is absent or present, respectively.
Make an algorithm that, for each class, calculates the percentage of absence and writes the identification of the class and the calculated percentage; determine and write down how many classes were absent greater than 5%.
